# PDS Scraping Tool
pds_scraper is a simple script for mass downloading data from a PDS Imaging Node. In its current form, this script is primarily intended for use with Mars surface mission data, especially from the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers (MSL and M2020).

This tool is in a Work-in-Progress state and should not be relied upon for external use at this time.
